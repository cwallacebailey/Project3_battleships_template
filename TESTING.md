## Manual Testing
---
## Pylint:
Pylint is in the code institute template and was used to "lint" the code. All errors are highlighted

The PEP8 Online system [Link](http://pep8online.com/) was used to check all python code. As Pylint was available throughout there were no errors. 

## HTML Validator

The HTML is part of the code institute template but I ran it through the HTML validator just in case. As you would expect it came back with no errors



## In Game Testing:
Throughout the development process I was testing the game in the gitbash terminal. Once complete the game was repeatedly tested in the CI replica terminal template on Heroku.

The game appears robust and by the time of submission there were no errors. 

## Inputs

The inputs were sources of early bugs due to integers being required and strings delivered. Due to the nature of the code used this should not be an issue but still I test the code by entering the wrong data type

## Bugs




## Remaining Bugs

At submission no visible bugs were known.
