# Battleships

## Overview

This project is a computerised game of battleships housed in a mock terminal on Heroku. The project has been an opportunity to gain knowledge and experience in an object orientated language, here python, and use classes, methods and nested 'if' statements along with ASCII artwork to create an enjoyable bug free playable game where a user faces the computer with two difficulty settings
